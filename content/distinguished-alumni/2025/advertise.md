You can help make this year's event a success by supporting it with an advertisement in our commemorative program. The Knight of Distinguished Alumni thrives thanks to the generosity of the Norwin community.

In previous years, advertisements have encompassed everything from heartfelt congratulations to our esteemed honorees from friends and family to supportive messages and well-wishes from local businesses. Your message will be woven into the fabric of our event, becoming an essential part of its narrative. Furthermore, sponsors will gain visibility on our website and Facebook page, receiving due recognition for their support.
