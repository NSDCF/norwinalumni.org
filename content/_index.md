Together, we are the Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, a group brought together by a shared love and appreciation of Norwin, and a desire to ensure Norwin always remains as a highly regarded premier school district.

The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, or NAFA, is as effective and fun as its members want it to be. Become a member and help build an organization with a positive impact on its members, the Norwin schools, its students, and our community.{{% /slide %}}
