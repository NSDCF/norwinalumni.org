Each year, the Norwin Alumni & Friends is proud to provide scholarships to graduating seniors aspiring to college dreams as well as younger students looking to explore their love of science and technology during Norwin's annual STEM summer camp programs.

We are able to help current Norwin students because of the continued support of past graduates, and you can be a part of those efforts.
