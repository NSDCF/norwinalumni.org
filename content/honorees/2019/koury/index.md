His love for Irwin quickly thrived with his multiple projects around the community that touched so many others as these projects enabled the town to continue to grow and prosper. Most notably is the interest of George and his partners interest in the Lamp Theatre that started its renewal and renovation in 2004 and the donation of the Lamp Theatre to the Westmoreland Cultural Trust. It is with that vision and desire to see the Lamp Theatre open again for the enjoyment of others, that his commitment maintained the opportunity for this community staple to once again light its stage.
