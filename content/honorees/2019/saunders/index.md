Victoria Saunders graduated in 2019 ranked second in her class of three-hundred and ninety-six students. Throughout her high school career, her love of challenges led her to take twenty AP and honors courses, earning thirty-three college credits. She was a member of the National Honor Society, the Psi Alpha psychology club, student council, the Interact Club, and served as her Class Office's recording secretary. She was a varsity letter-winner and captain of the Norwin girl's volleyball team and also managed the boy's volleyball team.

Outside of school, Saunders volunteered in the local community and rode along with paramedics from Norwin's Rescue 8 squad. She was awarded the Daughters of the American Revolution award, the Total Trib Media Outstanding Citizen Award, and received the Ben Carson Scholarship.

Her tenacity, hard work, and dedication has led her to The Ohio State University where she will major in Biology as a Health Sciences Scholar, with plans to go to medical school and become a neurologist.
