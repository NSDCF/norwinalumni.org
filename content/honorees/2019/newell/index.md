Heather Coiner Newell is the proud daughter of Ron and Anne Coiner and sister to Jack, Ted, and Brian Coiner. She is also the daughter-in-law of Terry and Carol Newell. Both the Coiner and Newell families have been North Huntingdon residents for many decades and delight in its strong sense of identity and community. When she was a Norwin student, Newell learned valuable leadership lessons as Colorguard Captain for the Norwin Marching Band and Winter Colorguard and as French Club President.

Newell was inspired by her grandmother to pursue teaching. She earned her B.S. in Secondary English and French Education from IUP. She then received an M.A. in Liberal Studies from Duquesne University. Newell completed her doctorate in 2016 at the University of Pittsburgh. Her dissertation focused on how principals effectively contribute to teachers' professional learning.

This year marks Newell's twenty-fifth year as an educator. Newell is thankful for the staff, families, and students for making her six years as principal of Sheridan Terrace Elementary School the very best ones of her career. She continues to learn each day and is grateful for her challenging and fulfilling job.

Newell is married to Bruce Newell, her best friend since elementary school. Both Newell and Bruce grew up in North Huntingdon and attended Norwin schools. They are life-long members of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Irwin. Newell and Bruce have two teenage daughters, Kendra and Brooke. The Newell family loves to travel and boat together.
