After graduating Norwin in 1986, John Tirpak attended Westmoreland County Community College and became certified as a paramedic, serving the community through his work in Emergency Medical Services for over thirty-four years. Tirpak has been part of North Huntingdon EMS/Rescue since 1995 and currently works as an Operations Supervisor and paramedic.

Tirpak has worked to develop two community children's injury prevention programs, the *Kids Safety Fair* and *How to Escape Abductions*, as well as a mobile healthcare program designed to help prevent elderly falls and help patients manage chrnoic medical conditions in their homes. In 2013, Tirpak was honored by EMS West and his peers for his contributions.

In 2013, Tirpak answered his call to ministry and began his studies in Leadership and Ministry at  Carolina College of Biblical Studies in Fayetteville, North Carolina, earning his bachelor's degree and graduating first in his class while receiving highest honors. He was inducted into the ABHE Delta Epsilon Chi Honor Society for academic excellence and ordained in 2017 with the National Association of Christian Minister's Fellowship. He has since served as a ministry leader and recovery pastor at Calvary Church in Irwin. Tirpak has also served as an intern and unofficial assistant pastor at West Newton United Presbyterian Chruch.

Tirpak has been married to his wonderful wife, Valerie, for twenty-eight years. They have two grown children, Kaitlyn and Alex, and he continues to be active in the Norwin community. Tirpak hopes to soon transition away from his work in EMS and into full-time vocational ministry.
