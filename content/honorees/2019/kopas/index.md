Westmoreland Counly Commissioner Ted Kopas has served in office since 2010. He manages a $330 million annual budget, nearly 2,000 employees, and oversees programs that touch on every aspect of our communities: human services, public safety, corrections, and economic and community development. He has worked closely with fellow public sector leaders, as well as those from the private sector and other civic leaders to confront the challenges facing our region-the opioid epidemic, an aging and shrinking population, infra足structure, long-term care for seniors, and local government cooperation.

Commissioner Kopas founded the Drug Overdose Task Force, consisting of a wide variety of stakeholders to confront the opioid epidemic and develop a comprehensive framework to curb overdose deaths. He initiated "Reimagin足ing Westmoreland", an update to the county's Comprehensive Plan to address the challenges facing Westmoreland County, including workforce demands, demographics and downtown redevelopment. Kopas was appointed by Governor Tom Wolf to represent Pennsylvania's 67 counties on the Governor's Long-Term Care Council to develop strategies and policies to best provide for the expanding needs of the Commonwealth's growing senior population and shrinking direct care workforce.

He serves on the Boards of Directors for the West足moreland Industrial Development Corporation, Westmore足land Community Action, the Westmoreland Conservation District, and the Westmoreland Land Trust.

A native of Westmoreland City and a 1991 Norwin graduate, Ted lives in Hempfield Township with his wife, April, and their five children: Elle, Alex, Quinn, Jack, and Teddy.
