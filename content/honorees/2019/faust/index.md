R. Neil Faust was born in Sewickley Township on January 26, 1935. He graduated from Sewickley High School in 1953 and California State College in 1957.

He received his master's degree from Indiana University of Pennsylvania and then his Principal's Certification from Pitt. He spent 36 years at Norwin School District as a teacher, principal, elementary supervisor, and transportation coordinator before retiring in 1993.

During his years at Norwin, Faust served as president of the Norwin Teacher's Federal Credit Union and the Norwin Council of PTAs. Faust was also a member of Saint John's United Church of Christ where he was on the consistory, a Sunday school teacher, member of the choir, and various other committees. He was well known for his great cooking ability for fundraisers such as the sauerkraut dinners at the church.

Faust married Nancy Vaughn in 1958 and they had 4 children, David, Cheryl, Susan, and Cindy, and were later blessed with five grandchildren. Faust passed away on his 71st birthday, January 26th, 2006. The family continues to keep his memory alive within the Norwin School District by offering an "Extra Effort Award" that is given to one or two 6th grade students at Norwin. His love for his family, friends, church, and community will never be forgotten.

He was truly a man who made a difference.
