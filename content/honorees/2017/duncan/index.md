While serving as President of Duncan Financial Group's Insurance Division for the past 15 years, John has overseen the company's unwavering delivery of the gold­level service its clients have come to expect.

John is a graduate of Indiana University of Pennsyl­vania, where he earned his degree in Business Management. He takes his civic responsibility seriously, a trait passed on by his father, who taught him the importance of supporting the community that supports his company. John has long-served as President of the Norwin Public Library Board, and is a board member of the Norwin Chamber of Commerce, where he co-chairs the annual Golf Outing. He is also member of the Norwin Rotary Club, on the Board of the Norwin School District Community Foundation, and a member of the Irwin Lions Club. John strongly supports Norwin's Student Athlete of the Week Program, where he is honored to present awards to the school's outstanding scholars and athletes. One of John's passions is Norwin's Relay for Life event.

John and Duncan Financial Group are also firmly committed to the events hosted by the Irwin Business and Professional Association, including such endeavors as the Irwin Jazz in the Streets, Ladies Night, Light Up Night, Cookie Tour, Car Cruise, and others.

Just as important to John is his family, which includes: his wife of 30 years, Donna; his son Lance, who also works at the company; daughter, Megan, a teacher at Vincentian Academy in Pittsburgh; and their beloved rescue dog, River. John is an avid golfer and enjoys a good game at the Madison Club. He also likes to travel and visit his camp in Potter County.
