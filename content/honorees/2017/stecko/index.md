Mr. Hunter J. Stecko, son of Eric and Danielle Stecko, will graduate this spring as valedictorian of Norwin High School's class of 2017.

In addition to his strong academic achievements, Stecko has been an active participant in a number of Norwin's clubs and organizations for the past four years. Most notably, Stecko served as president of the Norwin Speech and Debate Club and a three-year state and national qualifier, class president and student council representa­tive, president of the Norwin Select Orchestra, and treasurer of the Norwin Quiz Team. He has volunteered extensively with local organizations, including his local church, Saint Agnes, and served as a volunteer coach for the local 12u travel baseball team. His hard work and dedication has been honored through multiple awards and scholarships. Selected honors include recognition as a Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership (HOBY) delegate, National Merit Scholar­ship finalist, Coca-Cola Scholar semi-finalist, and one of Trib Total Media's Top 100 Citizens.

Hunter looks forward to continuing his education by pursuing undergraduate degrees in biomedical engineering and political science prior to medical school. It is his goal in life to be able to help develop new technology-based medical solutions to help treat diseases such as Alzheimer's. Stecko hopes to one day be able to serve his community's interests through politics.
