The call to action was made in 2010. Since then, Dina Denning has worked within two community service groups, first with The Norwin Rotary Club and now with The Norwin Lions Club, to bring assistance to the students of the Norwin Schools that are struggling with weekend nutritional needs.

With the financial backing of local businesses, organizations, and individuals; the volunteer work of many people; and a strong relationship with a local grocer, many children of the Norwin Schools are being served with Kitty Sacks to sustain themselves through the weekend.

In 2011, the project was kicked off with the Norwin Lions Club. Dina was able to convince the Lions to sponsor a new fund raising event, The Cubcake Wars. Now in it's fifth year, the Cubcake Wars puts home and professional bakers into competition with each other to determine the best Cubcake baker in the region. The event has out grown two venues and this year partnered with Stratigo's Banquet Centre. Earnings from the event are earmarked for the Kitty Sack project and assures that the project can be sustained for several years to come.

No child should go hungry. With Dina's commitÂ­ment and the continued support of the community, you can bet that no Norwin child will.
