Don Kattic had been the Commander of VFW Post 781 for 20 years, taught U.S. History at Norwin High School for 35 years and continues to promote and recognize our military servicemen and women.

His decision to join the Marines launched a lifetime of commitment and service not just to his country at large, but to his local community as well. After completing boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., Kattic was sent to California and then to fight on the front lines in the Korean War.

Don participated in operations against enemy force in Central Korea from 1952 to 1953. As a result he earned the Korean Service Medal, the United Nation Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal and the Navy Occupational Service Medal. After the conflict with Korea ended, Kattic joined the prestigious Marine Corps shooting team at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Because of his experiences in Korea, Kattic found a desire to pursue a career teaching U.S. history to high school students. Don earned his teaching degree from St. Francis University in Loretto, PA. He taught at Norwin for 35 years.

Since his retirement Don recently retired as the Commander of the VFW Post 781 in Irwin/North Huntingdon and held that position for over 20 years. As a veteran, he makes every effort to support both active and returning troops. In 2007 he worked to collect and donate more than 1,000 soccer balls and 800 stuffed animals to the children of Iraq. The collection was designed to give Iraqi children a moment of peace while in the midst of destruction.

Kattic has also been instrumental in the fundraising and restoration of the Veterans' Memorial in front of the North Huntingdon Township building, as well as the memorials on Main Street in Irwin and near the post office in Ardara. He serves as the master of ceremonies for the area's Memorial Day and Veterans Day parades.

One of Don's dreams was to erect a memorial on the Norwin campus to honor military personnel killed in combat since the district was formed in 1958. He has raised over $50,000 and was proud to host the Dedication Ceremony November 14, 2015.
