Al Lynn, along with his parents and sisters, moved to North Huntingdon in 1964. He played football and basketball at Norwin Junior High West. He graduated from Norwin High School, where he was a member of the football and track team, as well as chorus.
He received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education from Clarion State College and earned his Master of Science Degree in Education and Elementary Administrative Certification from Duquesne University in 1978.

He began his teaching career at Norwin in 1973 as an elementary teacher at Scull Elementary. He spent many years coaching football, basketball, and track. For the next 24+ years, he continued his passion for teaching at Scull and Hillcrest elementary schools until deciding to transition into administration. He served as the principal at Hillcrest and Sunset Valley elementary schools from 1998 until his retirement in 2006. Despite retiring, his passion for education and love of children led him to become principal at Queen of Angels Catholic School for a year and a half. His admiration for the Norwin School District allowed him to serve as a member of the school board for four years.

In retirement, he enjoys spending time hunting and golfing with his sons Ryan, Pat, and Nick. He also loves spending time with his three grandchildren, Megan, Jack, and Penelope. He would like to thank everyone in the community for all of the support they have given him throughout his truly enjoyable career as a teacher, coach, and administrator.
