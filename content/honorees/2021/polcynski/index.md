For the past four years, Mara has made her number one priority to be to not have an obvious number one priority. Her driving force has been to try to experience as many of the opportunities available within the Norwin community as possible. At Norwin High School her final class rank was fourth, she was a class officer (secretary) for four years, she earned a place in the Global Scholars program, and was a letter winner in five different varsity sports. In addition, her performance in her Advanced Placement Art classes earned her recognition as one of the top graduating visual artists in Westmoreland County.

Beyond her school activities, Mara was active in the community. She is a member of two churches, participating in both youth groups. Through these experiences, she volunteered at food banks in both Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties, provided community outreach service to less fortunate members of not only the Norwin community, but also several communities as far away as Steubenville, OH. She also spent time volunteering for Animal Friends in any capacity that they needed. And to ensure her life experiences were as well-rounded as possible, she has held two jobs for the past two years.

Mara is forever grateful to have had the opportunity to grow up in the Norwin area and has done her best to become involved in all it has to offer. She is confident that the education and experiences provided by our Community have prepared her well for success at Grove City College in the coming years.
