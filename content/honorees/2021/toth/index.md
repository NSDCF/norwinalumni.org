Since childhood, Dr. Jennifer Toth has had a passion for medicine. After graduating from Norwin, she attended Washington and Jefferson College where, in 1994, she earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Biology. In 1996, Toth earned a Master’s Degree in Physiology from Penn State University. She then attained her MD from the MCP/Hahnemann University School of Medicine in 2000.

Residency took her to Hershey, PA, to Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. She completed a residency in internal medicine, followed by additional training in pulmonary and critical care medicine. During residency, her daughter Antonina (2005) and son Cole (2007) were born.

In 2007, after graduation from fellowship, Toth assumed responsibility for the “bronchoscopy service” at Hershey Medical Center and, with the help of an amazing team of colleagues, built the section of Interventional Pulmonology (IP), a group of physicians and advanced practice clinicians with a passion for patient care related to the performance of procedures related to the diagnosis, staging, and palliation of benign and malignant lung disease. She established a one-year dedicated fellowship in interventional pulmonology at Penn State which is in its third year. She is nationally known within the IP community, and is the current president of the Society for Advanced Bronchoscopy, the first female professional society president within the field of interventional Pulmonology.

Toth is married to Dr. Michael Reed, Chief of Thoracic Surgery at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. They reside in Hershey with their three children.
