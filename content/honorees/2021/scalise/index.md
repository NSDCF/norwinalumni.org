My name is Kailee Scalise and I am honored to receive the NAFA Scholarship. I am currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing majors in Marketing and Supply Chain Management with a minor in Economics and a certificate in Leadership and Ethics.

Growing up in the Norwin area, I was very involved in my community and school clubs my entire life. I played club soccer starting at age 7 and joined the high school soccer team my freshman year. I was the President of the Norwin Show Choir, Vice President of the Bel Canto Women’s Choir, Class Secretary, and member of the Norwin Theatre Company where I landed multiple lead roles. I was also involved in the Aevidum Positivity Club, which is a club that I co-founded my senior year.

Through my vast involvement in clubs and activities, I developed an appreciation for community service. I’ve carried this important lesson with me as I entered college and now volunteer for a nonprofit organization called Lending Hearts. I hope to continue building my character and prepare myself to be successful in my future career.

As I reflect on my high school years, I cherish the memories I’ve made and I’m proud to be a Norwin alumni. Thank you again for this recognition.
