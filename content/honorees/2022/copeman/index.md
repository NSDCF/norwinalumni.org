Halle Copeman is a proud Norwin graduate. Halle played softball for PAL and Norwin, participated in track, played basketball for NCAA, and served as the statistician for the Norwin High School boys’ basketball team.

Siniawski earned a bachelor’s degree in marketing/business from Penn State University. Working at S & T Bank as a Retail Sales Associate, she has received many Incredible Customer Experience Awards, and is ranked as one of the top five employees in her position. Known throughout the community as Moola Moola—the S&T’s Children Savings Account Mascot—she participates in the Light Up Norwin Parade, and visits elementary schools preparing financial literacy lessons for young children.

Believing “the greatest example of love is to serve others,” she has been a long-time volunteer with the Irwin Business and Professional Association (IBPA). She serves as a chairperson for the Annual Ladies Night, is a Board member of Tom’s Turkeys, a member of the Norwin Chamber of Commerce, a committee member for Back the Blue, a volunteer for the American Cancer Society Relay for Life, Wreaths Across America and the North Huntingdon FOP golf outings. She supports the American Red Cross, and serves as a bell ringer for the Salvation Army.

Her love for children is evidenced as she reads each year for Hahntown Elementary School’s Reading with the Stars event. A member of Brush Creek Evangelical Lutheran Church, she has served on Church Council, volunteered for Vacation Bible School, and chaperoned the youth to Camp Lutherlyn.

Siniawski loves and enjoys her community, cherishing the many opportunities to serve the community she calls home and exemplifying the true meaning of community service. Her unselfish gifts of time and expertise have enhanced the many organizations she has served, resulting in positive improvements within the Norwin Community and making it an awesome place to work, live, and learn. In her free time she loves camping, making special memories, and carrying on traditions, with her husband Mark and their children Kennedy and Hayden.
