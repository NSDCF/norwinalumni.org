Dr. Daniel Medic, Jr. is a practicing physician serving his North Huntingdon community for over thirty years. He grew up on a farm in Shafton where his parents stressed the importance of education. 

He was inspired to pursue a career in medicine by an uncle, who was a family doctor.

After receiving the John B. Rodgers Scholarship during his high school senior year in 1971, the reality of becoming a doctor seemed possible. He graduated from Penn State University with a B.S. degree in Pre-Medicine. His education continued at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School in Developmental Biology. Prior to completing his degree, he was accepted to the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery in Des Moines, Iowa. He completed his training by serving a one year internship at Des Moines General Hospital, and a two year Residency Program in Family Practice at McKeesport Hospital.

From there, Dan completed a three year Public Health Service commitment for the local community in Toledo, Iowa, and for the Meskwaki Native American Settlement. In addition, he was the Assistant County Coroner for Tama County, Iowa.

Since returning to his hometown in 1990 to begin his Family Practice career, he was involved with other opportunities which included serving as the Norwin School District physician for twenty-six years; Medical Director for two hospice organizations; Medical Director and Preceptor at UPMC McKeesport Family Medicine D.O. Residency Program; and Medical mission trips to Jamaica.

Over the years, Dr. Medic’s recognitions include Public Health Service Physician Award; Fellow American Academy of Family Physicians; Greensburg Tribune Review People’s Choice Awards for Best Family Doctor in North Huntingdon (Gold and Silver, and Regional Award Winner Family Doctor (Gold and Silver).

As Medic begins his transition towards retirement, he recently sold his private practice to the Excela Hospital System. Dan has been married to his wife Julie for thirty-seven years, and together they have raised three daughters, and recently became grandparents.
