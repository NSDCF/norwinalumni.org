Sean Mainwaring is a lifelong resident of the Norwin Community. He attended Norwin School District for grades K-12, where he was heavily involved in sports and activities. From academics, lettering in football and track to participating in Show Choir, Sean’s dedication to the Norwin School District started at an early age. After graduating from Norwin High School, Sean pursued an undergraduate degree at Clarion University, where he graduated with his Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education.

Shortly after graduation, Sean was hired as a long-term substitute within the Norwin School District. The next school year, Sean was officially hired full-time as a fourth-grade teacher at Sheridan Terrace Elementary School, where he taught for the next 9 years. During 2015-2017, Sean then attended Delaware Valley University where he obtained his Masters of Educational Leadership and Principal Certification. A few short years later, he was assigned the Head Teacher position at Sheridan Terrace where he took on more administrative duties. He also supported the school district’s goal to assist students following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by serving as the Summer Academic Recovery Camp Coordinator.  That same summer in 2021, Sean very excitedly applied for and ultimately took on the role of the Principal of Sheridan Terrace Elementary School.

Sean could not be more proud or honored to have the opportunity to work at his alma mater alongside the wonderful faculty and staff in the district as well as families and students in our community. Sean currently resides in the Norwin School District with his wife and their three daughters.
