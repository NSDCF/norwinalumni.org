Ellis McCutcheon graduated in 1962 where he was a varsity letterman in basketball. He was a psychology major at IUP, and later earned graduate degrees at Auburn University and Nova University. A psychology professor for 35 years, Dr. McCutcheon’s 140 scientific research articles have appeared in several prestigious psychology journals. He is currently ranked in the 87th percentile against scientists from all over the world by ResearchGate, a website that disseminates research in all scientific disciplines. His six books include one about the psychology of baseball players who played briefly in the Majors – a copy of which is in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Another of his books chronicled the story of a Norwin student who was murdered and the subsequent investigation leading to a controversial conviction.

An amateur historian, he has written five pieces that were published in Westmoreland History, the most recent of which tells the story of the rise and demise of the summer playground program in Circleville, where he once served as a playground supervisor.

In the 1980’s he became an accomplished long distance runner, making the national rankings in his age division at the marathon and the 50 mile run.

In 1999 Dr. McCutcheon founded the North American Journal of Psychology, a journal which is currently found in virtually every American university library. As editor, he has overseen the publication of about 2,000 articles, and has mentored or collaborated with more than a dozen young Ph.D.s, including some from England, Hungary and the Philippines.
