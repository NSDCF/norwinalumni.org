Molly Hudson is a graduating senior student-athlete  at Norwin High School. Over the course of her high school career, Hudson has endeavored to make the most out of the opportunities offered by Norwin.

Ranked tenth out of four-hundred and three students in the 2022 graduating class, Hudson has pursued multiple honors and advanced placement classes during her high school career. At the same time, Hudson played soccer for all four years, including two years as a varsity defensive starter.

Hudson is the Vice President of the Class of 2022, and has worked with her fellow class officers to plan and execute events including the Homecoming Carnival, consignment sales, blood drives, prom, and graduation. She credits this work with helping develop a sense of leadership and experience that sheâ€™s applied to developing outside volunteer efforts including a Seniors to Seniors initiative in partnership with Redstone Highlands of North Huntingdon, an effort that was of particular importance to her.

Alongside those efforts, Hudson is a four-year member of the Peer Mentor and Buddy Club, which works to help foster an inclusive environment for all students, both those with and without disabilities. Whether it be bingo, Zoom workouts over quarantine, or blanket making, these experiences were an opportunity to help the community while bonding with friends.

Hudson plans to continue her education at Saint Vincent College, where she will study health science and education in pursuit of a career in education or speech pathology while also playing soccer.
