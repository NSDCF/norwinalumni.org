Tom Shrump graduated from Norwin in 1984. After graduation, he attended the University of Pittsburgh. Upon graduation from Pitt, he worked for the H.J. Heinz Company for many years until eventually ending up as Director of Operations at Armada Supply Chain Solutions, a job that he loved.

Throughout his high school years, Tom was a tuba player for the Norwin Marching Band. He was also a member of the Norwin 1982 Grand National Champion marching band - an honor he was so proud of.

Tom’s passion was the marching arts and the students who participated in them. His dedication and love for the arts was infectious as was his smile. You would rarely see Tom without a smile on his face.
