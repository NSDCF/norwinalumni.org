Once a Knight, always a Knight! Sara Colosimo has been a proud Norwin Knight since 1988. Sara feels that her educators played a hand in motivating her to become the person she is today. In addition to working hard in the classroom, she excelled on both the tennis and basketball teams, while also being involved in various clubs and organizations.

Colosimo attended Slippery Rock University where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education. While there, she played on the Women’s Division II Tennis team and served as the captain of the Women’s Ice Hockey Team. A member of honorary fraternities, she also traveled to Mexico City as a student teacher.

In 2007, she was hired as a teacher at Norwin, currently teaching full day Kindergarten at Hahntown Elementary School. This is where “The Christmas Family’’ tradition began in 2018 when she wanted to bring joy at Christmas time to a student and her family who were struggling. After asking for help on social media, an outpouring of support allowed her to buy the children gifts and give the “Christmas Mom” a check for $3,400. With a feeling of gratitude, Sara has continued “The Christmas Family”, seeing donations grow beyond the original goals and expectations - most recently receiving almost $10,000 in donations, multiple gifts and gift cards, and a 2019 Chevy Cruze.

She and her husband Andrew are the proud parents of three children: Francesca, Giada, and Giovanni.
