Dr. Terri L. Yost is a 1988 graduate of Norwin High School. She began her career as a registered nurse at Latrobe Hospital before accepting a commission in the United States Army Nurse Corps. She served for over 20 years before retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in 2016. Twice deployed to Iraq, Yost served as the Office in Charge of the Troop Medical Clinic and provided care to more than 10,000 service members, DoD civilians and coalition forces. She also deployed to Vietnam as part of a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency team to search for and retrieve the remains of military service members missing in action.

Academically, Yost earned a master’s degree as a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) from the University of Pennsylvania and a PhD in Nursing from the University of Virginia (UVA). Her scholarly honors include the Joan Lynaugh Award for Clinical Scholarship (2002) and the Carol Lindeman Award for a New Researcher (2012). She has developed questions for the ANCC FNP board certification exam, served as a working group member and co-author of DoD-level clinical practice guidelines and developed and taught workshops in evidence-based practice. Yost’s research includes the study of Qigong for military service personnel with chronic post-concussion syndrome, and cranial electrotherapy for restless legs syndrome.

Following her military career, Yost accepted a position as an Associate Professor at UVA where she currently teaches advanced practice nursing. She maintains her clinical practice as a volunteer FNP at the Greene Care Free Clinic in Virginia.
