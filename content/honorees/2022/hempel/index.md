Tom Hempel attended Central Westmoreland Vocational Technical School for much of his high school years. His career began as an Industrial Sales Engineer for DoAll Corporation. Fulfilling a childhood desire to become a police officer, he enrolled part time in the Police Academy. After completing the Municipal Police Officers Education, he became a part time officer for the borough of Manor, and then a full-time officer in Pitcairn, while still working for the DoAll Corporation. Retiring as an officer in 1999, he joined Philips Respironics selling sleep and home respiratory products where a promotion gave him the state of North Carolina as his sales territory. Retiring due to health, he said,  “I praise my Lord and Savior. He has truly blessed me. I give him all the glory!” Helping others gives him great enjoyment, and he lives by the philosophy “Thoughtful people hang with thoughtful people, good people hang with good people.”

Tom serves as CEO of his NON-PROFIT Organization “Tom’s Turkeys” which serves the Norwin area with ALDI gift cards for needy families so that no child will go to sleep hungry, is a member of the Norwin Chamber of Commerce, the Irwin Business and Professional Association, part of  the “Back the Blue’’ event which honored the area’s two great Police Departments last year, and is spearheading a committee which is organizing the 1st Norwin Area First Responders event for June.

Having the true blessing of being married to the love of his life, Linda, for forty-one wonderful years, they enjoy spending time with their son Jason and his wife and two wonderful girls, Ryleigh Ann and Harlow Remi, and son Brian.
