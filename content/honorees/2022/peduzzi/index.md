Born in 1933 in Trafford, Pennsylvania, Ron Peduzzi formed half of the famed Peduzzi Twins duo. Together, he and his identical twin Rey conquered Trafford High School, Geneva College and the United States Marine Corps from which Ron retired as Colonel.

In 1958 Ron took a job teaching math at Norwin and began a lifelong commitment to the blue and gold culminating in twenty-five years as the Norwin High School principal. During his early tenure at Norwin, Ron was an assistant coach for the football and baseball teams. In 1960, he helped lead the baseball team to the WPIAL Championship. In 1971, Ron became the high school principal, a title he held – and treasured - until 1996. More than 15,000 students graduated under the watchful eye of Mr. Peduzzi.

The students’ welfare was always Ron’s first priority and in 2002, after several suicides at local schools, Ron helped start Norwin Contact, a crisis suicide prevention hotline. In addition, Ron also served as President of the Association of Secondary School Principals.

A fixture in the community, Ron regularly participated in the annual Memorial Day parade adorned in his Marine Corps uniform. He was a member of the Norwin Chamber of Commerce’s Year 2000 Committee and you could often spot him tending flowers on the Route 30 traffic islands. The Norwin Rotary Club recognized Ron for his distinguished community service with the Citizen of the Year Award.

Supporting Ron at home was his wife Carolyn and their daughters: Mary, Lauren and Anita. In everything he did, Ron lived out his motto, “First Class All the Way!”
