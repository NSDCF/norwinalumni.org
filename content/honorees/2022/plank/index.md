After graduating from Norwin, Douglas Plank was recruited by Ohio State University to play football, graduating with a BA in Sociology in 1975. Despite requiring knee surgery, Plank played five games in his senior year, and managed to get drafted based on what he accomplished in those five games. He played in three Rose Bowl games, was drafted in the NFL, and played eight seasons at defensive safety for the Chicago Bears, as well as playing for the USFL Chicago Blitz while simultaneously selling real estate, giving sports talks, and renovating residential homes in the Chicago area.

During his time in the NFL, he led the Bears in tackles several years including his rookie season - the first to do so in Bears history. Defensive coordinator “Buddy Ryan” created a defense with Doug as the middle linebacker, naming it the “46” Defense after his jersey. Although his football career was over in 1984, the Bears won the Super Bowl in 1985 using the “46” Defense. It is still regarded as the gold standard for dominating and impactful defenses along with the Pittsburgh Steel Curtain.

Plank’s achievements found him being voted as one of the top “100” Chicago Bears of all times, one of the top 10 scariest players in the NFL according to a former sports magazine, he was inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame at Norwin High School, Sports Hall of Fame for Western Pennsylvania, and NFL Gridiron Classics. He is on the Board of the Harris Poll, and is a member of the NFL Trust which helps NFL players make the transition from NFL careers to occupations outside football.

A National QSR franchisee, he has experience in the selling and acquisition of business and real estate transactions, mortgage financing, investment  securities, residential contracting, and property entitlement. Doug has been an NFL national radio analyst for 15 years, coached in the Arena Football League, NCAA football at Ohio State University, and for the Atlanta Falcons and New York Jets. He is a public speaker providing sports talks to athletic teams, organizations, and crafting business solutions to companies interested in inspiring their workforce, and has operated Burger King restaurants for twenty-two years in Columbus, Ohio, Phoenix, Arizona, and Kansas City, Kansas.
