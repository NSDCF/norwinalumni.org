She then received an M.A. in Liberal Studies from Duquesne University. Heather completed her doctorate in 2016 at the University of Pittsburgh. Her dissertation focused on how principals effectively contribute to teachers' professional learning.

Heather is thankful for the staff, families, and students for making her six years as principal of Sheridan Terrace Elementary School the very best ones of her career. She continues to learn each day and is grateful for her challenging and fulfilling job.
