Rich Siniawski has always lived by the words of Vince Lombardi: "the harder you work, the harder it is to surrender." Born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, Siniawski grew up in Shafton and continued to live in the Norwin community where he would raise his children. His upbringing instilled a strong work ethic that continues to today, leading him to be an active volunteer in the Norwin community.

Rich has served our country in the Army during the Vietnam War. He carried mail in Greensburg for ten years, and then moved to Guardian Protection Services where he received the Presiden't Award, Salesman of the Year and the 100 percent Club Award for several years.

Siniawski has developed a reputation for his attention to organized games among the local kids. This is probably where his basketball career began. He coached basketball at Immaculate Conception, St. Edwards School in Hermanie, PAL, and Norwin Jr. High East. He served on the PAL Board and was largely responsible for organizing PAL Basketball Clinics for first and second graders, which later expanded to third and fourth grade and finally incorporated girls from NCAA into the clinics.
Rich has served as the President of TAB (Township Area Business Association). During these years, he was the Chairman of the Foothills Football Classic, a football game to recognize outstanding senior players from Westmoreland, Allegheny and Fayette Counties. In addition, he has volunteered as a member of the Norwin Chamber of Commerce where he received the Norwin Chamber of Commerce Member of the Year Award in 2014. While volunteering for the organization, he also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and remains on the board today. Rich is also the Vice President of the Church Council for Brush Creek Evangelical Lutheran Church.

He certainly feels if people work together they can make their community better. Rich will continue to serve others to make Norwin a better place. He enjoys collecting antiques, wine making, gardening and helping others, and continues to paly basketball and softball, too.

Rich lives in Strawpump. There is no finer gift than family, and it shows in Rich's greatest blessings: Sherry his wife of 45 years, his four children, Shannon, Rich, Jr., Halle and Seth, and his four grandchildren Hannah, Norah, Kennedy and Eddie.
