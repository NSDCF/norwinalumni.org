Dr. Constance DeMore Savine is proud to call Norwin School District her home. From the age of four, DeMore wanted to teach at Norwin like her father did; her long-term goal never changed. She was fortunate enough to be hired by Norwin in 1996 after graduating from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. While teaching middle school social studies, she earned a Master's Degree in Educational Leadership and a Principal's Certification from St Francis University.

Continuing her education, DeMore also earned a Certificate to Supervise Curriculum and Instruction and a Doctorate in Administration and Policy Studies from the University of Pittsburgh. Upon completion of her studies and after working for 19 years as a classroom teacher, she transitioned to serving as one of Norwin's Coordinators of Secondary Gifted Education. She also teaches two graduate level courses at Pitt and consults independently for school districts whose administrators hire her to aid teachers in their professional development. Teaching and learning are DeMore's passions, and she will forever be grateful for the opportunity to grow as a professional member of the community she holds dear.

DeMore is happily married to Christian Savine, a fellow Norwin High School graduate. Together, they enjoy parenting their two boys--Jackson and Landon--and chasing their two whippets--Eddie and Delilah. "I have been a Norwin Knight for forty-four wonderful years, and I am honored to be a part of this beautiful community," DeMore remarked.
