Casey Harper has lived a lifetime by his mother's words: "always remember where you came from, work hard, be honest, and give back." This knowledge and wisdom granted by his mother would activate Casey Harper's calling to make an impact. The homegrown and national contributions of C. Harper Charities are long and influential; they are directly involved with Norwin Athletics, the Police Athletic League (PAL), the local police department, Jamie's Dream Team, The Lamp Theatre of Irwin, the Jacktown Ride n' Hunt Club, Make-A-Wish, Toys for Tots and the Hines Ward Positive Athletic Foundation, to name a few. Yet he judges his success not by the growth of his endeavors or by the credit that comes with it, but by how he's been able to influence his community and inspire those around him.

Aristotle once said, "You are what you repeatedly do, therefore excellence ought to be a habit and not an act." His mother's early teachings would mold Casey into an embodiment of just that. His pureness and bigheartedness are unmatched, and his donations are aimed at instilling happiness, camaraderie, and most importanlty, fun. Those who know him trust him unwaveringly as his charities and generosity come with the most genuine of intentions, just as his mother would have wanted.

Along with his wife Cheryl, they have instilled these core vlaues in their own children, who are poised to carry on the legacy in the generations to come.
