David McCullough attended West Virginia University, studying trumpet with Roger Sherman and conducting with Don Wilcox. He developed an outstanding band program at Brooke High School in Wellsburg, West Virginia before becoming the Assistant Director of Bands at Syracuse University.

McCullough is a doctoral candidate in conducting at the University of Washington where he studied with Peter Er√∂s and Tim Salzman. He has conducted performances at the American Bandmasters Association National Convention, Regional MENC Conventions, and the College Band Director's National Association. An active arranger, adjudicator, clinician and guest conductor, Mr. McCullough has presented premiers of works by Walter Hartley, William O. Smith, and Brian Bittle.

Spending twenty-five years as Director of Athletic Bands at Butler University, in Indianapolis, McCullough conducted the marching, basketball, and campus concert bands and has taken basketball bands to the NCM men's national championship game three times. In 2011, in Houston, TX, Butler was the defending Final Four "Battle of the Bands" Champion after winning that title in 2010 in Indianapolis.

David's 350+ music arrangements can be heard from New Jersey to California as played by high school ensembles, and by collegiate bands from Syracuse, New York to the University of Hawaii. Currently he is the staff arranger for the University of Alabama's "Million Dollar Band."

As Director of Bands at Union College, McCullough looks forward to expanding the band and music programs and returning Union's Band to a position of distinction in Kentucky and the South/Midwest.
