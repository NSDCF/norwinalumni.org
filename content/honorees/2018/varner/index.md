Vance Varner is a 2018 graduate of the Norwin High School. During his time at Norwin, he strove to be active in academic and extracurricular activities. In school, he challenged himself with many AP and Honors classes, and was in the top five percent of his class. He has received awards such as National Merit Commended Scholar and AP Scholar with Distinction. Along with his academics, he feels that his extracurricular activities have also greatly defined him as a person. In school, he played for three years on both the high school soccer and volleyball teams. He has been involved in many clubs such as Model United Nations, History Club, Interact Club, and the Spanish Club where he served as treasurer. He is most proud of his work with the Boy Scounts. For eight years, he has been active in Boy Scout Troop 251 in Larimer. He recently earned his Eagle Scout rank upon completing his service project at the First United Church of Christ. Vance said that "Becoming and Eagle Scout, combined with all of my olther activities, has greatly helped me to becomme the young man I am today."

Varner will be attending Case Western University to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering. He hopes to help design and improve medical devices that can have a lasting impact on the lives of those affected.
