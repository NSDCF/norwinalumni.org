Annetta Marion is a Primetime Emmy Award-winning filmmaker, showrunner, and director whose work has garnered critical acclaim across documentary and scripted formats. With honors including an Oscar shortlist placement, a Hollywood Creative Alliance ASTRA Award, and BAFTA and Peabody nominations, Marion is known for her insightful, emotionally resonant storytelling and unshakable command of the production process.

Upon graduating Norwin, Marion had a very different vision for her professional future than what she would eventually discover. After earning both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in computer engineering, she launched a successful early career in the tech sector. But a volunteer project — producing a short documentary — unexpectedly ignited a passion for filmmaking that changed the course of her life. She left her engineering career behind and methodically worked her way up in the film and television industry, learning every aspect of production from the ground up.

Marion's directorial and producing credits span major networks and platforms, including Netflix, ESPN, Apple TV+, Amazon, OWN, MTV, and Investigation Discovery. She gained national recognition as a director and segment director for Oprah’s Master Class, earning a 2013 Primetime Emmy nomination, and later served as showrunner on a wide range of acclaimed nonfiction projects.

Her most celebrated recent work includes Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, which premiered to standing ovations at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Marion produced the film and served as second unit director. The project went on to win four Primetime Emmys, five Critics Choice Awards, and a HOPE Filmmaker Award at SXSW, while also earning BAFTA and Peabody nominations.

In 2025, Marion will premiere her newest project, First To The Finish, a docuseries she showran and directed in full. Set to debut on Amazon Prime, the series offers an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at three women navigating the fiercely competitive 2024 Mazda MX-5 Cup motorsports season.

Marion currently serves as an alternate on the National Board of the Directors Guild of America and is an active member of its Eastern Directors Council. She is a sought-after panelist and mentor in the film community and continues to develop a diverse slate of projects, including two documentary features, a narrative action film, and a short drama.

Known for her meticulous preparation, fearless work ethic, and ability to earn trust from both crew and on-camera talent, Marion brings integrity, artistry, and a sense of purpose to everything she touches. Her passion for storytelling is equaled only by her commitment to making meaningful, impactful work.
