Niko Kelly is a graduating senior from Norwin High School. He has lived in North Huntingdon Township his whole life, and both he and his parents have gone to Norwin throughout their whole childhood. Niko has taken numerous Honors, AP, and College in the High School courses throughout his time at Norwin High School, and while his schedule is packed with academic responsibilities and other extracurriculars and activities outside of school, he still manages to excel, earning himself a GPA of 107.

In terms of activities outside of school, Niko has been a member of the cross country and track team since middle school, running long distances with his friends and classmates. He is also a member of Student Council, National Honor Society, National Business Honor Society, Spanish Club, and Gardening Club.

One of his most fulfilling accomplishments has been his participation in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), where he has won first place in the regional events for Intro to Business Communication, Business Communication, and Banking and Financial Systems. Outside of school, some of his other activities include volunteering at the Light of Life Rescue Mission and the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Food Bank. His time at the former has been particularly impactful for him, as he directly assisted those in need in his community and felt like he was genuinely making a difference in the lives of those around him.

This fall, Niko will be attending the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering and Frederick Honors College where  he is excited to pursue both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Engineering. In fact, he has been pre-accepted into the graduate admissions program for Engineering at Pitt.

He then plans to attend law school, after which he can use both his law degree and engineering degree to become a patent attorney.
