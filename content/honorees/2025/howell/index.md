John Howell, a 1979 graduate of Norwin High School, has led a dynamic career in education, finance, and the performing arts, shaped by a lifelong commitment to service, leadership, and excellence. During his years at Norwin, John was a passionate and involved student, participating in Drama Club, Chorus, Concert Band, Jazz Band, and Marching Band, where he served as drum major for two years. He also played a pioneering role in establishing Norwin’s first men’s volleyball team and continued to support the marching band as a staff member for eight years after graduation.

John earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management with a minor in Accounting from the University of Pittsburgh, graduating magna cum laude. He later obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Business Education from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, graduating summa cum laude with highest academic distinction.

His professional career began in the financial sector, serving as a financial advisor at Irwin Bank & Trust. He then worked at Westinghouse as a contract negotiator for the Navy nuclear program, managing procurement for aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. John ultimately found his calling in education, serving as a Business Communication and Information Technology teacher at Hempfield Area High School. As department chair for a decade, he played a vital role in shaping the school’s curriculum, founding the district’s Personal Finance course—now a graduation requirement—and helping to write Pennsylvania’s Financial Literacy standards in collaboration with the Certified Financial Advisors of Pittsburgh and other statewide educators.

John’s contributions extend far beyond the classroom. A respected official in high school athletics, he has officiated basketball and volleyball for over 33 years through the PIAA and is affiliated with multiple organizations, including the Golden Triangle Volleyball Officials, Ohio Valley Referees, and the Professional Association of Volleyball Officials. His expertise has earned him the honor of judging national championships in the U.S., Japan, Amsterdam, and the United Kingdom for premier arts organizations such as Drum Corps International, Winterguard International, Music for All, and the Pennsylvania Federation of Contest Judges.

John is also deeply engaged in his church community. For over four decades, he has served in various musical and leadership roles. He currently directs the Chancel Handbell and Handchime Choir, a group he has been part of for more than 44 years. He chairs the church’s seasonal decorating and landscaping committees, has sung in the choir for 39 years, and has served as an assisting minister.

Through every role, John Howell exemplifies dedication, leadership, and a deep commitment to enriching the lives of others and the communities he serves.
