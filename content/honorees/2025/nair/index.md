Sarita Nair serves as the Cabinet Secretary of the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, where she leads the state’s efforts to strengthen its labor force, close critical workforce gaps, and expand access to equitable, sustainable career pathways. Appointed in 2022 by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Nair has brought decades of leadership in public service, law, and policy to the role, guiding the department through complex challenges—including disaster response during wildfires and innovative initiatives to increase labor force participation following the COVID-19 pandemic. Her collaborative approach emphasizes cross-sector partnerships and data-driven strategies that connect New Mexicans with high-quality, long-term employment.

Prior to joining the governor’s cabinet, Nair made history as the first woman to serve as Chief Administrative Officer for the City of Albuquerque. In this capacity, she oversaw 22 departments and managed a $1.2 billion budget, steering the city through major transitions and crises. Her tenure was marked by a commitment to public safety, equity, economic inclusion, and operational transparency. Before that, she served as Chief Government Accountability Officer and General Counsel at the New Mexico Office of the State Auditor, where she helped strengthen oversight and accountability across public institutions.

Before entering public service, Nair spent a decade in private legal practice as a shareholder at the law firm Sutin, Thayer & Browne. Her practice focused on business transactions, governance, and financing, serving both public and private clients. She is AV-rated by Martindale-Hubbell and has earned recognition from Best Lawyers, Southwest Super Lawyers, and Chambers & Partners USA. Earlier in her career, she worked in international development, consulting with organizations such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.

Nair is an alumna of the University of New Mexico, where she earned both her law degree magna cum laude and a master’s degree in community and regional planning. She received her bachelor’s degree in African American Studies from Wesleyan University. She currently serves as a Commissioner for the New Mexico Courts’ Access to Justice Commission and as a board member of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. She has been honored as a Top Influencer in Local Government and named Woman of the Year by Emerge New Mexico.
Born in Pittsburgh and deeply rooted in New Mexico, Nair is driven by a profound sense of purpose and public service. Outside of her professional life, she enjoys hiking, cheering on the Pittsburgh Steelers along with her beloved Lobos, and spending time with her daughter—who is an Aggie and a Mustang—and her Great Dane mix, Maximus.
