Trey Gerard Quealy is a 2015 Norwin graduate and a rising leader in business and community engagement. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 2019, followed by a Master of Business Administration from the University of Cincinnati in 2022.

At Norwin, Quealy was a four-year varsity athlete in both Cross Country and Track & Field, helping lead the Knights to a WPIAL gold medal in the 3,200-meter relay during his senior year. His athletic achievements, combined with his leadership and academic excellence, earned him the titles of “Most Outstanding Senior Male” and the “Kenneth Tray Male Scholar Athlete.” In addition to his athletic career, Quealy was deeply involved in student government, serving as Student Council President and as a Regional Representative on the Pennsylvania Association of Student Councils (PASC) State Board—experiences that helped shape his passion for service, leadership, and building strong communities.

Quealy carried that spirit forward at the University of Tennessee, where he competed on the varsity Track and Cross Country teams. He was named to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Academic Honor Roll five times and was selected to the 2019 SEC Community Service Team. Off the track, Quealy engaged in campus leadership, serving on the Leadership Studies Advisory Board and participating in the prestigious Leadership Knoxville Scholars (LKS) program, a two-year initiative focused on servant leadership, community impact, and social innovation. Through LKS, Quealy collaborated with civic leaders, participated in immersive service projects, and developed a deeper understanding of the region’s social and economic challenges. He graduated with a major in Supply Chain Management, dual concentrations in Data Analytics, and a minor in Leadership Studies.

In 2019, Quealy joined Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio, as a Process Engineer. Over the past six years, he has advanced within the company and now serves as a Senior Supply Chain Manager supporting North America Fabric Care brands such as Tide, Gain, Bounce, and Downy. He remains motivated by P&G’s mission to be a “Force for Growth and a Force for Good” in the communities it serves. Quealy is known among his colleagues for his collaborative leadership style, data-driven decision-making, and commitment to mentoring others in the workplace.

Trey draws great inspiration from his family and community roots. He is the grandson of Don Kattic, the 2017 Norwin Distinguished Alumni “Friend of Norwin,” and the son of Tom and Leslie Quealy, both Norwin alumni (Classes of 1982 and 1985). His achievements reflect the values instilled in him at Norwin and through his volunteer work, values which he continues to strive to live up to. Wherever his career and life may take him, Quealy remains—and always will be—a proud Norwin Knight.
