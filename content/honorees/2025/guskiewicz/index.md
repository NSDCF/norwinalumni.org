Adam Guskiewicz is a graduating senior at Norwin High School whose academic achievement, extracurricular engagement, and commitment to community service have left a meaningful mark on the school and surrounding community. A lifelong resident of North Huntingdon, Adam lives with his parents and two younger sisters and credits his close-knit family and supportive community for helping shape the person he is today.

Ranked 22nd in a graduating class of over 400 students, Adam has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. He has challenged himself academically by enrolling in Advanced Placement (AP) and College in High School courses, all while building strong relationships with his teachers and peers. Known for his diligence and intellectual curiosity, Adam has embraced every opportunity to grow both inside and outside the classroom.

Beyond his academic pursuits, Adam has been a dedicated member of several extracurricular organizations that have enriched his high school experience. He has actively participated in the Quiz Team, Interact Club, Spanish Club, and History Club, all of which have allowed him to expand his interests and develop leadership skills. Among the most impactful of these experiences, however, have been his involvement in Unified Sports and the Peer Mentor and Buddy Club—programs that promote inclusion, acceptance, and friendship among students with and without disabilities. These programs have helped enable Adam to build lasting connections and foster a deep appreciation for inclusive education. His dedication was recognized during his senior year, when he served as the club’s public relations officer.

Adam’s commitment to service is another defining feature of his high school journey. From loading food onto trucks for local pantries to organizing clothing drives, packing Christmas gifts for children, and volunteering to teach Spanish at elementary schools across the district, he has exemplified what it means to give back. Through these acts of service, Adam has gained a deeper understanding of the needs within his community and developed a strong sense of civic responsibility.

In the fall, Adam will attend Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he plans to major in Business Data Analytics. Drawn to the analytical side of business, he looks forward to pursuing a career that combines problem-solving, critical thinking, and data-driven decision-making. Though he is excited for the next chapter, Adam will always carry with him the memories and lessons from his years at Norwin.
