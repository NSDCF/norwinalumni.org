Michael and Kelly Doyle share a remarkable journey of community service that began in their youth and would grow into a life-changing partnership dedicated to addressing food insecurity and empowering individuals in McKeesport and surrounding areas. Their shared mission grew out of a deep concern for their neighbors and a profound commitment to making a tangible difference.

In 2014, Kelly founded the "What's Happening in White Oak and Surrounding Areas" Facebook group to connect residents and share local resources. What started as a community forum quickly became a lifeline for individuals in need, as Kelly and Mike began delivering care packages and food to families facing hardships. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the demand for assistance surged. The Doyles rose to the challenge, organizing food donations and delivery services for those unable to access traditional food banks due to transportation issues, illness, or vulnerability. Their home became an unofficial distribution hub, and they found themselves feeding between 5,000 to 7,000 neighbors every month.

Recognizing the need for a more sustainable and formalized operation, Kelly and Mike founded MISSION: AGAPE in 2020. Operating out of a repurposed church in White Oak, MISSION: AGAPE now provides food, clothing, and essential goods to thousands of area families. The organization serves as a community hub, offering food deliveries to households lacking available transportation, and providing services ranging from holiday meals to prevocational training and financial literacy programs. In doing so, they not only alleviate immediate hunger, but also promote long-term self-sufficiency.

Under their leadership, MISSION: AGAPEâ€™s community-centered approach has expanded to include initiatives addressing a wide range of needs, including support for veterans, hygiene products for teens, and job search assistance, and their partnerships with local schools, healthcare providers, and other community organizations have created a network of care that extends well beyond food security. Their vision for a more equitable and supportive community has fostered an organization that operates with efficiency, compassion, and impact.

Through their tireless efforts, Kelly and Mike have built a thriving nonprofit that empowers individuals to overcome systemic barriers and achieve self-sufficiency. Their work has not only transformed lives, but strengthened the fabric of their community, creating a ripple effect of hope, resilience, and opportunity.
