Bill Priatko was born and raised in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, where his passion for athletics and leadership began early. A proud graduate of North Braddock Scott High School, Priatko was a standout three-sport varsity athlete—lettering in football, basketball, and baseball—and was later recognized as one of the top twenty football players in the school’s storied history.

His achievements on the football field earned him a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh, where he continued to excel as a student-athlete and was named to the Ukrainian All-American Football Team. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in History and a Master of Education, and he received a commission as a Second Lieutenant through the Air Force ROTC.

Priatko served on active duty in the United States Air Force for three years. While stationed in Washington, D.C., he served in President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Honor Guard and was officer-in-charge of Air Force funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and was personally selected by President Eisenhower to lead a joint service cordon at the President’s Inaugural Ball. During his service, Priatko was also the starting center for the Bolling Air Force Base football team, earning All-Service Team honors as part of the National Service Championship squad.

Continuing in the Air Force Reserve for 17 more years, Priatko rose to the rank of Major, holding positions as an Aerial Port Commander and later as a Recruiting Detachment Commander, overseeing operations from the Midwest to the East Coast and contributing to missions that included support for the Vietnam War.

Priatko's athletic career extended into the National Football League, where he played linebacker for the Green Bay Packers, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers. Today, he holds the distinction of being the oldest living Steelers alumnus. A member of both the East Boros and Western Pennsylvania Chapters of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, Priatko's post-athletic career included roles as a sales representative for the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company and as Director of Salaried Recruiting at Volkswagen of America in New Stanton.

His lifelong passion for education and coaching led to a 25-year career that included positions as a history teacher and head football coach at Swissvale High School, assistant dean and defensive coordinator at California State University, and as assistant athletic director at Robert Morris University where he was inducted into the school’s Athletic Hall of Fame, and athletic director at Yough High School. He later served as a history teacher in the Norwin School District and continues to serve on the Norwin High School Athletic Hall of Fame Committee.

Bill was married for 57 years to his beloved wife, Helen, and has four children—Debbie, Dan, David, and Kathy—all proud Norwin graduates. He has lived in North Huntingdon for 65 years.
