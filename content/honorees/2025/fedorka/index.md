She is a nationally recognized immigration and law enforcement specialist, legal consultant, and public servant with a distinguished career committed to national security and protecting vulnerable populations. A proud Norwin graduate, Ms. Fedorka has worked to advance the integrity of U.S. immigration law, safeguard unaccompanied minors, and lead efforts to combat human trafficking and transnational threats. As Special Advisor to the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Joint Initiative at Homeland Security Investigations’ Center for Countering Human Trafficking, she leads investigative coordination, legislative drafting, and strategic policy development supporting White House directives. Her work helps dismantle smuggling networks and secure protections for minors at the U.S. border.

Abroad, she has provided legal service at the Center for Migrants’ Rights in Israel, assisting African political refugees and detainees. In Cuba, she studied foreign investment law at the University of Havana and helped coordinate a medical equipment donation to Havana Pediatric Hospital, training staff and fostering humanitarian ties.

She has received multiple federal honors, including the DHS Acts of Service Award, RAIO Global Excellence Star Award, and USCIS Silver Award, and has contributed to initiatives under the Executive Office of the President and DHS-led task forces.

Ms. Fedorka earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 2017, where she received the CALI Award for Lawyering Process: Negotiation, the Gismondi Fellowship, and the Nationality Rooms Scholarship, among other academic and service honors.
