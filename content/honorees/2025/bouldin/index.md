Betsy Frye, a 1980 graduate of Norwin High School, has dedicated her life to service—professionally, personally, and through her advocacy for families facing pediatric medical crises. For over 43 years, she has worked for UPMC in roles from medical assistant to charge processing specialist. Her career reflects values of compassion, reliability, and care for others.

Betsy and her husband Wilbur have been happily married for 43 years and chose to raise their family in North Huntingdon. Their son Luke and his wife Amanda have blessed them with a granddaughter, Piper, who brings immense joy. Family has always been central to Betsy’s life, including her late sister Cindy, her rock and best friend.

On March 24, 1997, Betsy and Wilbur’s lives were forever changed with the birth of their son, Lance Aaron Frye. Lance was born with three serious congenital heart defects, and his early days were marked by uncertainty. He underwent numerous surgeries, including heart reconstructions, a tracheotomy, orthopedic surgeries, and a heart transplant. Despite his medical challenges, Lance’s strength, generosity, and leadership were evident, particularly in his time at Dr. Bill Neches’ Heart Camp for Kids, where he found a deep sense of belonging.

When Lance lost his battle with cancer at age twenty-one, Betsy turned her grief into purpose. Lance had always dreamed of helping other families facing similar challenges, and Betsy made that dream a reality by founding Lance’s Heart Strings, a nonprofit organization that has since distributed over $106,000 in financial aid to families with children receiving care in cardiac ICU, cardiology, and oncology wards. The organization alleviates the hidden financial burdens of hospital stays, such as food, lodging, and lost income, allowing families to focus on their child’s recovery.

In addition to direct grants, Lance’s Heart Strings has donated over $30,000 to Heart Camp, ensuring that children with heart conditions continue to experience the joy and support Lance treasured. Betsy’s hands-on involvement with social workers and hospitals ensures that aid reaches the families who need it most, always with empathy and a profound understanding of their journey.

Betsy’s leadership has created not just a charitable organization, but a network of hope. Through Lance’s Heart Strings, she honors her son’s legacy daily, helping lift the weight from families’ shoulders while reminding them they are not alone. Through each card she writes, grant she approves, and family she touches, Lance’s light continues to shine.

For her extraordinary dedication, resilience, and impact on families across Pennsylvania and beyond, Betsy Frye exemplifies the spirit of Norwin and the highest ideals of public service. She is honored to be named a 2025 Norwin Distinguished Alumni and to represent her son’s legacy and her community with love, courage, and grace.
