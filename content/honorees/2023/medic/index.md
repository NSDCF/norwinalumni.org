Dr. David Medic was raised on Medic’s Farm, overlooking Shafton, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and several area communities. Weekends, summers, and holidays were filled with relatives, family friends, incredible food, and enjoyable times. After graduating from Norwin in 1967, he attended Penn State University Park for three years. During his second and third years, he lived and worked at PSU’s beef barns, and also worked at the horse barns and the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory as his class schedule permitted.

Medic was accepted into the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University following his three years at Penn State. After completing his freshman year at Cornell, he returned to PSU for the graduation ceremony to obtain his B.S. Degree in Animal Science. He was proud and privileged to represent the College of Agriculture as Class Marshal for the event.

After obtaining his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree in 1974, Medic joined a large animal practice in Bradford County, Pennsylvania for three years and then another large animal practice in Bedford County, Pennsylvania for one year. Striking out on his own in 1978, he started a solo large animal practice serving primarily dairy farms in Mercer County, PA, and has been living there ever since on his 75-acre farm.

Medic is a founding board member of the Mercer County 4-H Foundation and currently is its Chairman. He is a member of several agricultural and professional veterinary organizations. He has served on the Pennsylvania Veterinary Medical Association’s (PVMA) Board of Trustees for about 15 years and has helped organize many local and state veterinary meetings, as well as extensively revised the PVMA’s Constitution and Bylaws. He was honored to receive the PVMA’s Veterinarian of the Year Award in 1994 and then, in 2011, received the PVMA’s Lifetime Achievement Award.

Medic initiated, organized, and managed the NWPVMA Equine Symposium, which brought world-renowned equine veterinarians to Mercer County to educate horse owners, veterinarians, trainers, farriers, and anyone else interested in learning about all things equine. Over fifteen-hundred different individuals attended over the thirteen years that the Symposium was held. As a result of the Symposium’s popularity and continued success, $40,000 was able to be donated to aspiring young veterinary students and recent graduates that sought to have a career in equine veterinary medicine and surgery.

Medic’s daughter, Gwen, lives in Virginia with her husband Jessie and son Declan. Gwen is a Physical Therapist at the University of Virginia Hospital.
