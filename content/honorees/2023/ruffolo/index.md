After Charles D.A. Ruffolo met his Dutch wife, Herma, the American soldier exchanged his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the Netherlands in the Dutch province of Drenthe/Overijssel. He served and retired after 20 years from the military and is a graduate of the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy, where he served as a Battalion Sergeant Major. He is a member of the US Army’s Sergeant Morales Club for being a dedicated professional whose leadership is characterized by true personal concern for the needs, development, and welfare of the soldier. He earned his MPA/MBA degree in his free time while in the military and fine-tuned his natural talent for linking (networking) common interests.

Ruffolo is an international speaker, author, publisher, and trainer who has spoken in many countries, presenting over 100 times each year and is the most requested American speaker in Europe.

Charles has hosted his dear friend Stedman Graham several times in Europe, twice Honorable William Jefferson Clinton, 42nd President of The United States, Sir Richard Branson (Virgin), General (ret) Wesley K. Clark (former NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander, Europe), Vice President Al Gore in Aruba, and Tom Houck, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s personal driver and assistant. He was instrumental in setting up the TV Station 24Kitchen in the Netherlands, which was sold to FOX International. He worked closely with the management of Six Flags to establish a roadmap that met their business objectives to position and brand their attraction park in the Dutch market. He also created The NetworKing Academy Online course, a first in the world. Charles served on the Advisory Board of the NFL European League.

The cardinal rule of networking is giving back. Ruffolo believes it’s so essential that in 1999, he founded the Giving Back Foundation, a non-profit committed to bringing critical resources to the youth who need them. The Giving Back Foundation helps high-school students whose career perspectives, due to their backgrounds, are not on the same level as their talent and ambition. These students, who may potentially be role models in Dutch society and have the ability to develop themselves best, are offered a group and mentor program to help them broaden their knowledge and experience. Giving Back only functions from private donations from companies and people who want to give back to society.

Charles has written three books on networking – Network Your Way to Success, Your Wake-Up Call, and It’s About Building Relationships Through Networking—and created a NetworKing card game called the “Ruffle Shuffle.” The books and card game are available in English, Dutch, and Chinese.

Charles and Herma have been married for forty-three years.
