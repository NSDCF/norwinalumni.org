Dillon Stein, D.O., is the Director of the Division of Palliative Care at Butler Health System in Butler, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Norwin High School in 2003, he received his undergraduate degree in Biology from Alfred University, followed by his medical degree from West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. Subsequently, he moved back to Pittsburgh and completed an Internal Medicine Residency and Chief Residency at West Penn Allegheny Health System. After finishing his Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2016, he began practicing palliative care in Butler where he helped establish an inpatient consult service and began the only outpatient palliative care clinic in rural Butler County.

In addition to leading the Division of Palliative Care, he has been the Chair of the Department of Medicine for Butler Memorial Hospital and is a contributor on the health system’s Innovation Team.

He provides leadership and mentorship through the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine’s Rural Special Interest Group. Dillon is a past Hearst AAHPM Leadership Scholarship Awardee and was selected to represent the early career perspective on the 2020 AAHPM COVID-19 Impact and Alignment Taskforce. Additionally, his beliefs in the benefits of gifting and gratitude led to a project involving the delivery of care packages to cultivate support and community with other hospice and palliative care programs. Thus far, he and his team have sent over 50 “palliative care packages” across the country.

Dillon is a passionate physician who strives to bring quality and compassionate palliative and end-of-life care to his community and rural settings. For his approach, he was named a “2023 Top Physician Under 40” through the Pennsylvania Medical Society and received national recognition by being awarded the “Hastings Center Cunniff-Dixon Early Career Physician Award” in 2022, which is presented to an early career physician that illustrates exemplary care for individuals and families at end-of-life. Dillon believes that patient care is driven by individualized medical care, connection, and relationships and hopes to inspire others to approach end-of-life care the same way in their communities.

Lastly, and most importantly, Dillon is a proud husband and father. He is married to his best friend and high school sweetheart, Bethanie (Willson) Stein, and they have three incredible children: Clara, eight, Beau, six, and Eliza, 18 months.
