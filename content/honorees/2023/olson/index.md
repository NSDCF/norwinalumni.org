Christopher Olson resided on North Street in Circleville until he departed for college. His formal education began with Kindergarten on WQED, followed by attending Circleville's Junior High School West, and finally, Norwin, where he graduated in 1969.

Despite being uncertain about his career path at the time, he decided to pursue marine biology. This eventually led Olson to transfer to Bucknell University, a choice made in part because the biology program was not premed-oriented. During his freshman year at Bucknell, a classmate convinced him to explore medicine in a summer externship at Monsour Hospital. It was a decision that would change Olson’s direction in life.

A year after graduating from Bucknell in 1973 with his BS in Biology, Olson was accepted into what is now known as Des Moines University. He interned at Lakeside Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, before moving to Athens, Ohio, to join the faculty of the new osteopathic medical college at Ohio University, including as an associate professor at the end of his time at Ohio University. While there, he also completed a residency in family medicine at the Doctors Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. In 1987, Olson and his family relocated to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he joined the growing Family Practice Center. He became an owner of the practice and was involved in its expansion from two offices to over twenty prior to his retirement in 2014.

Early on, Olson’s senior partners encouraged him to become involved in various medical organizations. Olson would go on to serve as the President of Medical Staff at Evangelical Community Hospital in Lewisburg, serving over twenty-five years as a medical advisor and board member for the Northcentral Pennsylvania chapter of the American Red Cross, and over ten years as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Pennsylvania Osteopathic Medical Association.

In 2016, the Pennsylvania Society of the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians honored Olson with the Raymond J. Saloom, D.O., F.A.C.G.P. Memorial Award in recognition of his accomplishments throughout his career.

Meanwhile, he and his wife raised two accomplished children who have become leaders in business and medicine. They also have four brilliant grandchildren who are their motivation for living and for relocating to New Hampshire. After his children had grown, Olson found time for golf and eventually skiing.
