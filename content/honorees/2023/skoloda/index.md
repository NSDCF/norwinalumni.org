Kelley Skoloda, née Murray, M.B.A., is the Founder and CEO of KS Consulting & Capital LLC, where she works with her son, Jake, for clients across the country. Kelley was previously a partner at the global PR firm Ketchum and is the co-chair of the Investment Committee at the Next Act Fund, a Pittsburgh-based angel investing group comprised primarily of women that focuses on investing in female-led early-stage companies.

Working at Ketchum for over two decades, first as a Director of Business Development, an Associate Director of the Global Brand Marketing Practice, and then as a Partner and Director of the Global Brand Marketing Practice, Skoloda made her name as an expert in consumer brand marketing with a focus on marketing to women. In this role, Skoloda’s team pushed groundbreaking research that helped some of the world’s largest consumer brands connect with women and mothers. Skoloda would go on to find her greatest passion in building the Marketing to Women & Moms team at Ketchum, turning the practice into a top revenue-generating area for the firm before moving on from the firm to start KS Consulting & Capital in 2017.

In striking out on her own, Skoloda managed to build a unique marketing consultancy that specializes in marketing to women and mothers, the recruitment of women in professional trade associations, and more. At the same time, Skoloda has made a name for herself as a Pittsburgh-based angel investor, investing in female-led businesses. Since 2020, she has also served as a board member for the Angel Capital Association, the world’s largest organization of angel investors. 

Her business book, Too Busy to Shop: Marketing to Multi-Minding Women, was named a “must-read” by Publishers Weekly, while her second book, A Way Back to Health: 12 Lessons from a Cancer Survivor, was an Amazon #2 best-seller in the cancer category.

Named one of the “most influential women in business” by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Kelley has been quoted in HuffPo, Time.com, TODAY.com, Fortune.com, Adweek, C-SPAN, and others. Kelley has served on a variety of boards of directors, including the Excela Health System, Seton Hill University, and as a member of the Board of Trustees for UPMC’s Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation. She has been a regular speaker at leading conferences, including the Consumer Electronics Show, BlogHer, and more.

Skoloda earned her MBA at the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business and her undergraduate business degree at Seton Hill University. Kelley and her family live in Greensburg with their three cats.
