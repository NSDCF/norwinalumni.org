The Norwin Alumni & Friends Association, in cooperation with the Norwin School District Community Foundation, is now accepting nominations for the 2023 Class of Distinguished Alumni.

The 2023 class will feature up to twelve alumni who have had careers of distinction since their days at Norwin High School.

In addition, the NAFA Executive Board may select one Distinguished Friend of Norwin to be honored for service to Norwin schools and community.

Recipients will be honored at the sixth annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni Recognition Dinner, to be hosted in May, 2023 at Stratigos Banquet Centre in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.
