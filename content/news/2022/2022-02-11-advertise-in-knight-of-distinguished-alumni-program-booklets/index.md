Our [2022 Knight of Distinguished Alumni]({{< ref "/distinguished-alumni/2022/index.md" >}}) is fully funded through the support of the local Norwin community. Towards that end, we are respectfully asking local businesses to assist us in making this event a success by placing an ad in the commemorative program. Ad sponsors will also be recognized on the NAFA website and Facebook page.

Any profits netted through this event will be used to support the NAFA Scholarship fund and other NAFA activities benefiting the Norwin community and students.

Recipients will be honored at the fifth annual Knight of Distinguished Alumni Recognition Dinner, to be hosted on Thursday, May 26, 2022 at Stratigos Banquet Centre in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.
