We always enjoy doing our best to support the Norwin community. We also enjoy a good meal. That's why we're always excited to participate in the Norwin Rotary Chili Cookoff and Wing Thing each year. This year had some great competition, and although our chili didn't win, we did win best presentation for our Happy Camper booth.

Next year's a different story, however. But that's all in good fun.

We'd like to take a moment to thank the Norwin Rotary for hosting yet another fun event and everyone in the Norwin community for participating. Events like this are a fun reminder of how wonderful the community is when they come together.
